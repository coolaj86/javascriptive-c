JavaScriptic-C

Just a few sparse tools to make writing C faster.

Fun Goal
----
It's crazy, but the ultimate ultimate ultimate goal would be to write a JavaScript interpreter in C, which C is written in JavaScript. JavaScript Interpertor written in JavaScript, PreProcessed as C, Compiled as Machine Code which interprets JavaScript.

Again:

JavaScript <- JavaScript -> C -> JavaScript <- JavaScript
